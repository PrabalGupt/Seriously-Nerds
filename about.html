        <div>
            <p>The Feeding Poor Organization is evolving an ecosystem for food security interventions to support
                thousands of feeding programmes in India by bringing the government, private sector and NGOs together to
                fight hunger and malnutrition in India.</p>

            <h1><b>Our Vision</b></h1>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>Our vision is to have a hunger and malnutrition free India. We aim to achieve this by establishing a
                strong and efficient network of FoodBanks throughout the country, so that every district has access to
                at least one FoodBank by 2030.</p>

        </div>
        <div>
            <p>COVID-19 pandemic and the various restrictions have also created a food crisis for many who are
                struggling to access enough food to feed themselves and their families. Feeding Poor Network is a hunger
                relief organization in Delhi and is coordinating a massive effort in 10+ cities of Delhi to provide
                grains, groceries, and packaged products to feed these vulnerable families. Corporates, not for profit
                organizations and individuals who believe in their role in eliminating hunger in India, join hands with
                us to feed the hungry.</p>

            <h1><b>Our presence in India</b></h1>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>Currently, we are present in Delhi only, but we are looking forward to serve in other cities as well as
                in other states.</p>
